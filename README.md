### Description
simple script to get a specific list of addresses out of the KBO dataset based on
- A subset of NACE activity codes
- A subset of zipcodes


Limitations of the current version:
- Was created for a specific query in Flanders, so it isn't adapted to take into account French addresses
- It doesn't utilize the adresses of the 'vestigingen'
